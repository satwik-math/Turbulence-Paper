This result was obtained from an experimental study conducted in a fluival engineering laboratory; the entire findings are submmited to a journal for peer review. A short description regarding the relevant scientific terms are provided <a href="assets/Reynold's Shear Stress.md" style="font-size: 20px; color: gray; margin-right: 7px">here</a>.

The following figure shows how well a neural network can predict turbulent $` F `$ values.
